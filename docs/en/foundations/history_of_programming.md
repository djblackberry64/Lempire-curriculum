# History of programming

## Humble beginnings of programming

## Low Level Predecessor Languages

### Can I have your compiler?

To keep it short: C used Assembly to write it's compiler.

**Now you may ask: But how can it be that there's C code when I look up the source code of the C compiler?**

Let's see what happened there:

So the base of the C compiler is assembly code which in turn is translated into binary code.

_How can the compiler be written in C then? - It isn't really written in C._

Under the hood it's all Assembly. They just used Assembly to code the necessary parts of the language compiler and could then use the C programming language itself to extend its functionality.

If you wanna have a specific history from a compiler borrowing progression:

Binary > Assembly > C (1973, Dennis Ritchie) > C++ (1983, Bjarne Stroustrup) > Java (1995, Sun Microsystems) > Kotlin (2011, JetBrains)
